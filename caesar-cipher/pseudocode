1. import string
2. Define a function "caesar_cipher" which takes in 3 inputs: plaintext, key, action
3. Convert the plaintext to uppercase
4. Remove spaces from the plaintext
5. Convert fullstop to "X"
6. Create an empty list "ciphertext"
7. Check if the action is "encrypt" or "decrypt"
8. If it is neither, return an error message
9. Loop through each character in the plaintext
10. If the character is a letter, encrypt or decrypt it depending on the action and key
11. Add the encrypted/decrypted letter to the "ciphertext" list
12. If the character is not a letter, add it to the "ciphertext" list without encrypting/decrypting
13. Join the list of characters back into a string
14. Return the ciphertext or plaintext
15. Create a while loop
16. Ask the user if they want to encrypt, decrypt or quit
17. If they enter "encrypt" or "e", call the "caesar_cipher" function with the plaintext, key and action "encrypt" and print the ciphertext
18. If they enter "decrypt" or "d", call the "caesar_cipher" function with the plaintext, key and action "decrypt" and print the plaintext
19. If they enter "q" or "quit", exit the program
20. If they enter anything else, print an error message
